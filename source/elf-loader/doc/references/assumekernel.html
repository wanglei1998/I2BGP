    <h1>Explaining <tt>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</tt></h1>

    <p>Ulrich Drepper, 2004-5-12</p>

    <p>It is frightening how something as simple as the mechanism
    behind <tt>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</tt> can create that much confusion.  So
    here are a few details which should enable everybody to
    investigate the issue closer by her/himself.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>First, <tt>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</tt> is handled by the dynamic
        linker.</p>
       </li>

       <li>
         <p>The behavior of a specific value of <tt>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</tt>
	 is <b>not</b> hardcoded in the dynamic linker.</p>
       </li>

       <li>
         <p>Every DSO (Dynamic Shared Object, aka shared library) can
         tell the dynamic linker in glibc which minimum OS ABI version
         is needed.  NB: dynamic linkers other than glibc's do not
         have this feature.  The information about the minimum OS ABI
         version is encoded in a ELF note section usually named
         <tt>.note.ABI-tag</tt>.  This note section must be referenced
         by a <tt>PT_NOTE</tt> entry in the DSO's program header.</p>

         <p>To examine the content of a DSO's note section use the
         <tt>readelf</tt> program from <tt>elfutils</tt> (the version
         from <tt>binutils</tt> is not capable enough).  On Red Hat
         system the binary is called <tt>eu-readelf</tt>.  Using it on
         a Fedora Core 2 system shows the following:</p>

         <pre>$ eu-readelf -n /lib/tls/libc-2.3.3.so

Note segment of 32 bytes at offset 0x174:
  Owner          Data size  Type
  GNU                   16  VERSION
    OS: Linux, ABI: 2.4.20
</pre>

         <p>This means the <tt>/lib/tls/libc-2.3.3.so</tt> DSO
         requires at least OS ABI version 2.4.20.</p>
       </li>

       <li>
         <p>The specific ABI version requirements on a RHL9, and
         Fedora Core 1 and 2 system are as follows (NB: this implies
         IA-32 is the architecture):</p>

         <ul>
           <li><p>DSOs in <tt>/lib/tls</tt> need ABI version 2.4.20.</p></li>
           <li><p>DSOs in <tt>/lib/i686</tt> need ABI version 2.4.1.</p></li>
           <li><p>DSOs in <tt>/lib</tt> need ABI version 2.2.5.</p></li>
         </ul>

	 <p>This means no <tt>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</tt> setting requesting
	 versions earlier than 2.2.5 will work at all.  Versions from
	 2.2.5 to 2.4.0 will use the DSOs in <tt>/lib</tt>, versions
	 from 2.4.1 to 2.4.19 will use the DSOs in <tt>/lib/i686</tt>,
	 versions 2.4.20 and younger will use the DSOs in
	 <tt>/lib/tls</tt>.</p>

         <p>For the Red Hat releases this layout was chosen to provide
         the maximum amount of backward compatibility for
         <b>broken</b> applications (correctly written applications
         have no problems anyway).  The code in <tt>/lib</tt> consists
         of the very early LinuxThreads code which had fixed size
         threads which could not be placed by the application.  The
         version in <tt>/lib/i686</tt> is the LinuxThreads code which
         does away with this limitation (aka floating stacks).  The
         code in <tt>/lib/tls</tt> is the new NPTL POSIX thread
         library.</p>

       </li>

       <li>
         <p>The fact that a DSO has a more stringent version
         requirement does not mean it is automatically chosen.  The
         dynamic only rejects loading DSOs based on the version
         information, it does not look for the best fit.  The above
         description is true because the dynamic linker always looks
         in the directories <tt>/lib/tls</tt>, <tt>/lib/i686</tt>, and
         <tt>/lib</tt> in this order.  Why this is the case is
         complicated and not explained here.  Read the dynamic linker
         source code.</p>
       </li>

       <li>
        <p>For architectures other than IA-32 the situation is
        similar, but less complicated.  In RHEL3 only two versions of
        glibc are needed, one using LinuxThreads and one using NPTL.
        The very old LinuxThreads code is not needed.</p>
