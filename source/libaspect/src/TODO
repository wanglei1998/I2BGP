first, we need to write functions to parse all various forms and report
their value as a single 64bit integer
this means that we need a dw2 expression interpreter for block forms
this means that we need to handle reference forms correctly. how ? I don't know.
then, we need to rework the callback api: use a per-attribute callback to report
the value for each attribute.
then, the caller must be able to compose callbacks with and/or propositions
for each attribute so that it can check for the presence of
a set of attributes in an entry.
then, the caller must use the pubnames section to lookup function names
then, must figure out the line number information.
